# Link Extractor
This application is a simple Python script that allows you to extract download links for files from a web page. The links are displayed in a scrollable list in the GUI, and you can save the links to a file if desired.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Tkinter

```

Or run the .exe file
Enter the URL of the web page you want to extract links from in the input field, and select the file types you want to extract.

## Limitations
- The application only extracts links from a web page.
- The application may not work for all websites, as some websites have security measures in place to prevent scraping.
- The application may not be able to extract all of the links from a web page, as some websites may use JavaScript or other technologies to dynamically load content.
